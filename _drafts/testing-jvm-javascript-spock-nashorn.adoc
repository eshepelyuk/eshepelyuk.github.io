= Testing JVM server-side JavaScript using Jasmine, Spock and Nashorn

`JavaScript` is not only browser powered client-side or `NodeJS` powered server-side code.
Many `JVM` based projects are also using it as internal scripting language.
Testing this sort of functionality is neither straightforward nor standard.
In this post I intend to show approach for testing `JavaScript` code in server-side JVM environment
using well-known tools like `Jasmine`, `Spock` and `Nashorn`.

* not well integrated to build process
* not well integrated into IDE, i.e.
** no possibility to run single test from IDE
** unable to view results from IDE
* tight coupling to browser environment
* no possibility of using cusomized `JavaScript` executor

<1> `Nashorn` specific code adjusting `Jasmine` for non-browser environments. Not a part of `Jasmine` distribution.

<1> additional variable for data provider to underline ignored test

.Disadvantages
* unclear way of detecting line of source code particular where error happened
* still no ability to run single _specification_ from `Jasmine` suite
* incomplete reporting about ignored tests
