Let's create comfort command line environment, then install Docker.

== Installing Git

* not only `git` but `msys2` with `bash` shell and useful `Linux` command line tools.
 
== Installing Conemu

* link to installation guide
* how to run new consoles in the same window
* integrate with shell

== Installing Docker and running Docker container

no icons, pure cmd line

* start.sh
* run test docker image form manual

=== docker-machine

no need to intercat with VirtualBox UI, pure cmd line
