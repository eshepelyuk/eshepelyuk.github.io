= Advanced integration of Jekyll and AsciiDoctor

Using `AsciiDoctor` as markup renderer in Jekyll is quite straightforward 
but there's some gaps not covered completely in setup guides over the web
so I'd like to fill them in this post.

This tutorial implies you already having sample Jekyll site created 
and AsciiDoctor plugin enabled as described in corresponding guides.

* http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/[Jekyll installation^]
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll-AsciiDoc plugin^]

Let's create page `sample.adoc` and put it to root folder of the site.

[source]
.sample.adoc
----
---
---
= Sample Page
:layout: page

This is a sample page composed in AsciiDoc.
Jekyll converts it to HTML using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].

TIP: very important tip

[source,ruby]
----
puts "Hello, World!"
----
----

After running Jekyll you should be able to see sample page at http://localhost:4000/sample.html.
But you could notice something wrong with generated HTML.

== Displaying AsciiDoctor icons using FontAwesome

By default AsciiDoctor renders markup icons, like admonitions, etc., using HTML image tags and relies on physical images presence.
But there is no need to put image files for each of such an icon.
Instead one could leverage so *icon font* concept supported by AsciiDoctor.

`FontAwesome` is currently default icon font library used by AsciiDoctor.
It is a specialised vector font comprising icons images instead of letters,
thus allowing you to display nice and scalable icons on a web page without need for using any PNG/JPG/etc files.

Add font library to your site as described in *BootstrapCDN* section
of http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/[FontAwesome Get Started^] guide.
As for sample Jekyll site you should modify `include/head.html`.

Then enable AsciiDoctor font icons support in Jekyll config.

[source,yaml]
._config.yml
----
asciidoctor:
  attributes:
    - icons=font
----

== Setting up source code highlighting with Coderay

Missing source code highlighting on previous screenshot is caused by improper work of default Jekyll source highlighting library `Pygments` on Windows PC like mine.
I've replaced it with `Coderay` - pure Ruby implementation, to overcome the issue.
This entire section can be skipped if you are using `Pygments`.

To enable Coderay support adjust Jekyll config by adding couple of additional AsciiDoctor attributes.

[source,yaml]
._config.yml
----
asciidoctor:
  attributes:
    - icons=font
    - source-highlighter=coderay
    - coderay-css=style
----

== The outcome

After performing all the steps described above you will see full featured HTML at `http://localhost:4000/sample.html` address.
