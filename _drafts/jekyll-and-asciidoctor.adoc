= Advanced integration of Jekyll and AsciiDoctor

Using `AsciiDoctor` as markup renderer in Jekyll is quite straightforward 
but there's some gaps not covered properly in setup guides over the web
so I'd like to fill them in this post.

This tutorial implies you to have sample Jekyll site already created 
and AsciiDoctor plugin enabled as described in following guides.

* http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/[Jekyll installation^]
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll-AsciiDoc plugin^]

Let's create sample page `sample.adoc` and put it to root folder of the site.

[source]
.sample.adoc
----

= Sample Page
:layout: page

This is a sample page composed in AsciiDoc.
Jekyll converts it to HTML using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].

[source,ruby]
----
puts "Hello, World!"
----

TIP: very important tip
----

After running Jekyll you should see following content at http://localhost:4000/sample.html

What is wrong with generated HTML ?

== Setting up icons using FontAwesome

Download required files from http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[FontAwesome site^]

Enable AsciiDoctor font icons support in Jekyll config.

[source,yaml]
._config.yml
----
asciidoctor:
  attributes:
    - icons=font
----

== Setting up source code highlighting with Coderay

Missing source code highlighting on previous screenshot is caused by improper work of default Jekyll source highlighting library `Pygments` on Windows PC like mine.
I've replaced it with `Coderay` - pure Ruby implementation, to overcome the issue.
This entire section can be skipped if you are using `Pygments`.

To enable Coderay support adjust Jekyll config by adding couple of additional AsciiDoctor attributes.

[source,yaml]
._config.yml
----
asciidoctor:
  attributes:
    - icons=font
    - source-highlighter=coderay
    - coderay-css=style
----

== The outcome

After performing all the steps desribed above you should be able to see such picture after navigating to `http://localhost:4000/sample.html`.
