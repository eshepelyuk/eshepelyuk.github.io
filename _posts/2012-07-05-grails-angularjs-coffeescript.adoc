= Grails + AngularJS + CoffeeScript

== Intro

Responsive design is a must for modern web-applications. Today this is attempted to achieve by using JavaScript MVC frameworks.
But more often than not those frameworks originate from `Rails`, `NodeJS` and other non-Java communities.
This makes it hard for Java-boys (as me) to jump into. So purpose of this short tutorial is to explain in few easy steps how to start with JS MVC framework and `CoffeeScript` on `Grails`.

In this certain case `AngularJS` is my personal choice taken up after playing around with few other libraries but principles described below should work for other frameworks.

Our intention will be to write one-page application having single input field and what's typed there is immediately reflected below in span tag.

I'm assuming readers could be unfamiliar with AngularJS, but, still, the application is really simple and should be easy to read.

== Implementation

First let's create Grails application::
`grails create-app testApp`

After application is created let's change folder and all subsequent commands should be executed there::
`cd testApp`

`Grails` already has plugin that support on-the fly conversion of your `CoffeeScript` files into `JavaScript`. To install it type following::
`grails install-plugin coffeescript-resources`

After plugin installed we are going to create empty file for our `CoffeeScript` sources at `web-app/cs/angularIndex.coffee`::

What's great about Grails - is the fact that it abounds with plugins. `AngularJS` library can be installed by typing::
`grails install-plugin angularjs-resources`

Thanks to great `resources`  plugin `JavaScript` files management is quite easy in `Grails`::
[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/MyResources.groovy
----
modules = {
    angularIndex {
        dependsOn 'angular'
        resource url: 'cs/angularIndex.coffee'
    }
}
----

Code above declares resource for our AngularJS module written in `CoffeeScript`
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-spuDAAAxpPE/T_X4Cg8IDYI/AAAAAAAABXw/Zk1mc6dVu6M/s1600/1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">

Next we need controller to serve starting point HTML with AngularJS module. We can do it with following command::
`grails create-controller AngularIndex`

Also we need manually create Grails view for index action of our controller.  For this we have to create new file with following content
[source,html]
----
.grails-app/views/angularIndex/index.gsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <r:require modules="angularIndex"/>
    <r:layoutResources/>
</head>
<body ng-app="MyApp">
<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
    What typed reflected below
 
    <input type="text" ng-model="myText"/>
 
    <span><b>{{myText}}</b></span>
</div>
</body>
<r:layoutResources/>
</html
----
Last step is to create AngularJS module in CoffeeScript. For this we have to fill `web-app/cs/angularIndex.coffee` created before with following content::
[source,coffescript]
.web-app/cs/angularIndex.coffee
----
app = angular.module "MyApp", []
app.controller "MyCtrl", ($scope) ->
  $scope.myText = "INITIAL"
----
Let's run application::
`grails run-app`

== P.S.

Please notice that setup described above shouldn't be considered for production usage. 
You probably need minification, zipping resources, etc - but then again it can be good starting point for research, prototyping and similar activities 
towards developing modern front-ends.
